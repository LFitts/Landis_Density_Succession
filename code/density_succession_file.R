#' Density succession file creation
#' Things to include:
#'  Input file
#'  Initial communities (species list+parameters), density of each age cohort, map
#'  Ecoregions+parameters
#'  Dynamic input file (species probability of establishment) (not use this?, use recruitment from microplot)
#'  Ecoregion's growth rate (for each species)
#'  Biomass variable file (biomass estimation coefficients)
#'  Output
#'  Stocking coefficients
